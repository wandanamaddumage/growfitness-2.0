      "Before Grow Fitness, Samuel worked in marketing. Good training in understanding people, but not where he wanted to build a career. Frustrated with an education system that boxes kids into what they're \"good at\" too early, he set out to build the opposite: a place where kids discover their own talent, at their own pace.",
      "He's studying the NSCA Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning, and is a CPD certified Nutrition Advisor for recreational athletes. But the real reason runs deeper than fitness: Samuel believes sport builds the same muscle as entrepreneurship, and sees Grow Fitness as one step toward raising a generation of Sri Lankan kids who grow up to build things of their own."

      "Samuel wouldn't stop nagging him about doing something bigger with all that experience. Stephan didn't need much convincing. He naturally enjoys being around kids, playing with them, building games. The talent and the love were already there; Grow Fitness just became the place where both could matter."
